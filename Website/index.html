						<h1>What are we making</h1>
						<p>
							Our aim is to develop an interactive learning tool that visually demonstrates the behaviors and uses of key algorithms and data structures, titled Professor Alberton’s Algorithmic Adventures.

						<h1>Why learn with Professor Alberton</h1>
						<p>
							Our product will help secondary students enter Computer science and IT degrees with a greater base understanding and will excite them in regards to the excitement of learning how programs can work. It will also support secondary students in developing their logic skills which is a core part of programming and life.

							In relation to tertiary students it will support them on their journey of learning to develop software by enforcing base concepts that is required through out a Computer science degree. Algorithms are the core ingredient and forms the foundations of Computer science by learning how to think logically it will enhance the students ability to understand what’s happening behind their programming code.

						<h1>Professor Alberton is more than just a teaching tool</h1>
						<p>
							Our product will preform two main roles:
							1. To educate and entertain secondary school students on computer science by giving them a chance to gain a basic understanding of the sort of knowledge required entering a CS degree.

							2. Algorithms and data structures are essential knowledge for computer science students so through our product we hope to educate and entertain. Our main goal is to take a subject that can be seen as relatively boring and add a twist of fun.
