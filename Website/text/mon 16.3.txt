Hey everyone. The resource from has been signed and handed in. The following mostly concerns the week 6 presentation. So far we have: A broad purpose ...though we are somewhat sketchy on the target market since we are taking more of a hands on, 'gamey' type approach. A deployment environment, and we know what technologies we'll be using. A design methodology -we are looking quite strong in this regard, but I think this is the one area we need to sit down and really quiz each other on.  We all need to have a working knowledge of program states, and event driven design because as I understand, any of us can be questioned on this. It might be an idea to chalk up some slides for the presentation this Friday.  That way we can edit them in subsequent meetings and we'll all be comfortable with the presentation. Do your diaries!
