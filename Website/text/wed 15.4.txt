Hey all, So I just found out the diaries are due Friday, 7:00pm -it's only the presentation that was delayed. This includes all our individual diaries, and the group diary/meeting minutes. Please take time to ensure your diaries are up to scratch, that they include all the work you have done so far, and are somewhat presentable. We should spend a little time on Friday going through the meeting minutes/group diary. Can you please reply when you've read this email :p Regards, Ben
