      <h1>What are we making</h1>
        <p>
          Professor Alberton's Aglorithmic Adventure is a learning tool to teach secondry and tertriary students about Algorithms and data structures. Through the use of games and demonstration we hope to insert a greater understanding of algorthims and data structures which is a key part of any computing degree. We all know that studying computer science can be boring so we hope through a fun learning uttlity we can improve the students ablitty to learn a complicated topic.
        </p>

      <h1>Why use our product</h1>
        <p>
          Our proudct will help secondry students enter Computer science and IT degrees with a greater base understanding and will excite them in regards to the excitment of learning how programs can work. It will also support secondry students in developing there logic skills which is a core part of programming and life.

          In relation to tertiray students it will support them on there journey of learning to develop software by enforcing base concepts that is requierd through out a Computer science degree. Algorithims are the core ingredient and forms the foundations of Computer science by learning how to think logicaly it will enhance the students ablity to understand whats happenign behind there programming code.
      <h1>Our product is more than just another learning tool</h1>
        <p>
          Our product will preform two main roles:
          1. To educate and entertain secondary school students on computer science by giving them a chance to gain a basic understanding of the sort of knowledge required to enter a CS degree.

          2. Algorithims and data structres are essential knowedge for computer science students so through our product we hope to educate and entertain. Our main goal is to take a subject that can be seen as relativly boring and add a twist of fun.
