				<h3>Monday 16/03/2015</h3>
				<p>"Hey everyone.<br>

					<br>The resource from has been signed and handed in.<br> 

					<br>The following mostly concerns the week 6 presentation.<br> 

					<br>So far we have:<br> 

					<br>A broad purpose ...though we are somewhat sketchy on the target market since we are taking more of a hands on, 'gamey' type approach.<br> 

					<br>A deployment environment, and we know what technologies we'll be using.<br> 

					<br>A design methodology -we are looking quite strong in this regard, but I think this is the one area we need to sit down and really quiz each other on.We all need to have a working knowledge of program states, and event driven design because as I understand, any of us can be questioned on this.<br> 

					<br>It might be an idea to chalk up some slides for the presentation this Friday.  That way we can edit them in subsequent meetings and we'll all be comfortable with the presentation.<br> 

					<br>Do your diaries!  Upload them now!<br>

					<br>Thanks whoever attended today's lecture :$<br> 

					<br>Kind regards,<br> 

					<br>Ben

					<h3>Wednesday 01/04/2015</h3>
					<p>We have a week long break coming up, and though it would be amazing to spend the time working on our amazing project, it just isn't feasible due to work and other commitments.<br><br>

					We should still meet Friday week though as we have two tasks ahead of us. ​<br><br>

					<ul>
						<li>The first project milestone is the presentation which will happen on Monday April 20th.</li>
						<li style="list-style-type:none">
							<ul>
								<li>I need everyone to forward me their availability for that date by Monday April 6th.</li>
								<li>I have a second draft of the slides, so we can practice the presentation</li>
								<li>We should have a full dress rehearsal for Gene to offer some constructive criticism, hopefully on Friday April 17th.</li>
							</ul>
						</li> 
						<li>I plan to have the requirements properly documented and cataloged</li>
						<li style="list-style-type:none">
							<ul>
								<li> We already have a good handle on the functional and non functional requirements</li>
								<li> If we break them down into sub-categories, they amount to about 50-60 so far</li>
								<li> It's a horrible job, I know, so if we all do it together it should only take a few hours</li>
								<li> We need some "shall not's" and some "should not's"<li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>We need to finalize the coding style guide</li> 
							<li style="list-style-type:none">
								<ul>
									<li>We already have some snippits of sample code</li>
									<li> We already have a prototype "project skeleton" on the repository</li> 
									<li style="list-style-type:none">
										<ul>
											<li>The sooner we get the documentation up to scratch, the sooner we can start pumping out prototypes!</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li><br><br>
							I have been in touch with Dr Xia regarding two previous attempts at a similar project.  He was even kind enough to openly discuss relative, general marks and  where one of the projects went wrong, and where the other went particularly well.<br><br>

							 On Thursday morning I am going to pick up the documentation and binaries for those projects so we can perhaps get some idea of what to do, and what not to do.<br><br>

							 Just an aside -Gene mentioned the previous project, Luke pointed me to Dr Xia, and my inquiries have led me to believe this is all well above board.<br><br>

							  Thanks everyone.<br><br>
							   Happy Easter!
